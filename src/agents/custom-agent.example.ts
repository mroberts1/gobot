/**
 * Custom Agent Template
 *
 * Copy this file to create your own specialized agent.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Copy this file: cp custom-agent.example.ts my-agent.ts
 * 2. Update the config (name, reasoning, tools, prompt)
 * 3. Register in src/agents/base.ts (add case to getAgentConfig switch)
 * 4. Map to a Telegram topic in topicAgentMap
 *
 * Reasoning styles:
 * - "ReAct": Reason + Act cycles (good for research)
 * - "CoT": Chain of Thought (good for step-by-step analysis)
 * - "ToT": Tree of Thought (good for exploring multiple options)
 * - "RoT": Recursion of Thought (good for iterative refinement)
 * - "devils-advocate": Challenge and stress-test
 * - "adaptive": Mix based on context
